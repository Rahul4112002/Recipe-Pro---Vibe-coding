# RECIPE PRO

**Turn your fridge leftovers into delicious recipes instantly.**

---

## Project description

RECIPE PRO is a React-based UI that converts ingredients (typed or spoken) or an uploaded dish image into a full, cookable recipe. It returns a catchy recipe name, an ingredient list with quantities, step-by-step instructions, and an AI-generated dish image. Built for prototyping and demos — extendable to a full product with secure API keys, persistence, and deployment.
